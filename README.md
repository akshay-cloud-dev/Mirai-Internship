## 📌 Overview
This repository showcases the projects I built during my **AI Summer Internship** at **Mirai School of Technology**.  
The main focus of the internship was to gain hands-on experience in **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Automation, and AI Agents**.  

I developed two key projects using **Lovable AI** (for front-end design) and **N8N** (for backend automation & workflows):

1. **Order & Feedback Automation System**  
2. **Traveller Planner Project**
